# MTK6580 AsteroidOS boot logo

## Usage

The \*.rgb565 files are raw data images that can be edited with tools such as "Image Search Editor" (Windows-only but works in Wine). They are then packed in a logo.bin file by pack-logo.pl. The logo.bin file can be flashed on MTK6580 watches using SPFlashTool.

## Licenses

The pack-logo.pl script is based on MTK-Tools by Bruno Martins under Apache 2.0 license https://github.com/bgcngm/mtk-tools

The images are extracted from a KW88 firmware. Images 00 and 38 are generated from the AsteroidOS logo which is licensed under the CC-BY-SA-2.0 license.
